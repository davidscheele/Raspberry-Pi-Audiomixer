# Raspberry-Pi-Audiomixer
This little python script is my way of turning a Raspberry Pi into a mobile background-music machine with sound effects.
Intended to be used for board and role playing games. When ran it will start a pygame application and accept user input on the keyboard. The numbers (Keypad not supported yet) change the channel around and the letters are used to fire sound effects.
